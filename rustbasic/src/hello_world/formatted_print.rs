//! formated_print module shows the basic printing by a seris of macros
//! defined in std::fmt
//!
//! format! - write formatted text to String
//!
//! print! - same as format! but the text is printed to the console (io::stdout).
//!
//! println! - same as print! but a newline is appended.
//!
//! eprint! - same as format! but the text is printed to the standard error (io::stderr).
//!
//! eprintln! - same as eprint! but a new line is append.alloc

    // without a suffix, 31 becomes an i32.
